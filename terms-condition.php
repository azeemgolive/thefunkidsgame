This Privacy Notice explains the types of personal information we collect and how we use, disclose and protect that information.
<h3 style="color:#614cfa; font-weight:bold;">What does this Privacy Notice apply to?</h3>

This includes information collected offline through our Consumer Engagement Centres, direct marketing campaigns, sweepstakes and competitions, and online through our websites, applications and branded pages on third party platforms and applications accessed or used through such websites or third party platforms <strong>(“GoLive Sites”).</strong>
This Privacy Notice also applies to targeted GoLive content, including offers and advertisements for GoLive products and services, which we (or a service provider acting on our behalf) may send to you on third party websites, platforms and applications (“Third Party Sites”) based on your Site Usage Information (as defined below).  These Third Party Sites may have their own privacy policies and terms and conditions. We encourage you to read them before using those Third Party Sites.   
This Privacy Notice is hereby incorporated into and forms part of the terms and conditions of use of the applicable GoLive Site.  For information about the GoLivecompany responsible for protecting your personal information, see<a href="" style="color:#fa4cf4;"> Your privacy rights and who to contact</a> below. 
<h3 style="color:#614cfa; font-weight:bold;">Your consent</h3>
By using a GoLive Site, you are consenting to the relevant GoLivecompany collecting, using and disclosing your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Notice. If you do not agree to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in this way, please do not use the GoLive Sites or otherwise provide the relevant GoLive company with your personal information.

GoLive will only collect, use or disclose your personal information where it is fair and lawful to do so.

We may ask you to provide additional consent if we need to use your personal information for purposes not covered by this Privacy Notice.  You are not obliged to provide such consent but if you decide not to then your participation in certain activities may be restricted.  If you provide additional consent, the terms of that consent shall prevail in the event of any conflict with the terms of this Privacy Notice. 

Please note, however, that we may process your personal information without consent if we have a legitimate reason to do so, provided that such use will not have a prejudicial effect on your own rights, freedoms and interests.  Any such use shall be in accordance with the GoLive Privacy Principles set out above.

If you are a child over the age where parental consent is required in your country, you should review the terms of this Privacy Notice with your parent or guardian to make sure you understand and accept them. 
If we discover that we have collected information from a child without consent from a parent or guardian where such consent should have been obtained, we will delete that information as soon as possible. 
Access to certain parts of the GoLive Sites and/or eligibility to receive prizes, samples or other rewards may be limited to users over a certain age. We may use your personal information to carry out age verification checks and enforce any such age restrictions.
